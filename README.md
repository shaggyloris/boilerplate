This repo is intended to store some boilerplate code for common use cases I come across.

- FastAPI
  - Contains a basic FastAPI application that demonstrates some basic configuration and authentication functionality
- API client
  - Contains a generic API client that is used as an abstract class to build clients for other APIs
